## Description

A peg jumping game that is similiar to single player checkers. The user jumps pegs over other pegs that are adjacent to each other. The goal
is to leave as few pegs left standing as possible as a fun test of brain power. This project was created for my Artificial Intelligence class, CS455,
at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.

## How to Use

#### Installation

PegGame.py, displayFunctions.py, gameFunctions.py, searchFunctions.py, and the images folder must all be downloaded and in the same file location.
Run the application by running PegGame.py.

#### How to Play

- To play as the user simply click the pegs you wish to perform jumps with, if you wish to run the AI then select the corresponding button displayed.
- The Peg Game is played by completing jumps with the pegs like in the game "Checkers" and removing pegs that are jumped from the board.
- Pegs can only jump linearly and over pegs directly beside the starting peg.
- The game is over when no more jumps or moves can be made.
- The goal of the game is to leave as few pegs standing at the end of game.
- Peg holes are numbered from 0 to 14, starting at the top and then going row by row down and left to right.
- See attached "pegBoard_grid_references" in the "images" folder as it illustrates the numbering schema of the board.

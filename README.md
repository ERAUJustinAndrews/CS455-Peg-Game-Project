# CS455 Peg Game Project
 This is my final project for CS455. For this project I created a Peg Game solver using search algorithms.

 This game can be played by the user or the game can be played with search algorithms solving the game.

 To run this game PegGame.py, gameFunctions.py, and displayFunctions.py must all be in the same folder.
 In the same folder a folder as these files should be a folder named "images".
 This folder shall contain all images used in the game.
